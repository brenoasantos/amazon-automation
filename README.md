# Amazon Automation
Amazon Automation is an application developed to perform a simple task that consists of searching for products on the Amazon website using a keyword provided by the user, accessing the first (non-sponsored) product found and displaying its main information through the terminal. The information presented is:
- Title;
- Price;
- Number of units sold;
- Rating;
- Number of reviews;
- Feature bullets.
  
In short, the application automates the process of searching and presenting information about a specific product on Amazon.
